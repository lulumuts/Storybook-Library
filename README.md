# Storybook-Component-Library

Connect a Vue project to Figma and Storybook.

This was built as a Proof of Concept and is inclusive of an npm package configuration in order to use this package externally for better maintainance and usability across a wide codebase.

To see how it works, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/lulumuts/Storybook-Library.git

```

next we need to install the package locally by running:

```
npm run install

```

finally, to see storybook running, make sure to run:

```
npm run storybook

```

NB: The package on npm is currently private and so will be updated in the future to be used as external resource.
